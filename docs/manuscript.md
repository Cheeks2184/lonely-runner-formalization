# A formal investigation of the Lonely Runner Conjecture

## Status

This manuscript does **not** claim a proof or disproof of the general Lonely
Runner Conjecture. It is maintained in lockstep with the Lean sources. Any
result described as formal below must name the corresponding declaration and
must build without `sorry`, `admit`, or added axioms.

## 1. The circle and runner positions

The track is the additive quotient `R / Z` with circumference one. A runner of
speed `v` is at the quotient class of `t*v` at time `t`. The quotient metric is
the shorter circular distance. This is represented by:

- `LonelyRunner.UnitCircle`
- `LonelyRunner.position`
- `LonelyRunner.circleDistance`

in `LonelyRunner/Definitions.lean`.

## 2. The conjecture

For `N >= 2` total runners with an injective real speed assignment, the
canonical target requires that for every chosen runner there is a real time at
which its distance from every other runner is at least `1/N`. The closed
boundary and the order `forall runner, exists time` are essential.

The Lean declarations are:

- `LonelyRunner.LonelyAt`
- `LonelyRunner.Conjecture`

The canonical declaration uses unrestricted real time.
`LonelyRunner.NonnegativeTimeConjecture` records the common nonnegative-time
variant, and `LonelyRunner.conjecture_iff_nonnegativeTimeConjecture` proves the
equivalence by time reversal.

## 3. Relative velocities

Subtracting the chosen runner's speed makes it stationary. Circular distance is
translation invariant, and the other runners have velocities `v_j-v_i`. The
Lean declarations are:

- `LonelyRunner.RelativeLonelyAt`
- `LonelyRunner.RelativeConjecture`
- `LonelyRunner.lonelyAt_iff_relativeLonelyAt`
- `LonelyRunner.conjecture_iff_relativeConjecture`

The conventional formulation has `N-1` distinct nonzero moving speeds and one
stationary runner. The exact finite reindexing is formalized using
`runner.succAbove : Fin (N-1) → Fin N`, whose range is precisely the complement
of the chosen runner. In the other direction, `Fin.lastCases` appends a
zero-speed runner at the final index. The denominator is preserved as the
identity `(N-1)+1=N`; no cardinality or quantifier change is hidden. The Lean
declarations are:

- `LonelyRunner.DistinctStationaryConjecture`
- `LonelyRunner.injective_lastCases_zero`
- `LonelyRunner.injective_relative_succAbove`
- `LonelyRunner.relative_succAbove_ne_zero`
- `LonelyRunner.conjecture_iff_distinctStationaryConjecture`

`LonelyRunner.StationaryConjecture` separately allows repeated moving speeds.
The declaration
`LonelyRunner.distinctStationaryConjecture_iff_stationaryConjecture` proves
that this does not strengthen the global conjecture: it enumerates the finite
range of the tuple, applies the distinct statement in that lower dimension,
and weakens the resulting stronger denominator bound. Thus the formal chain is

`Conjecture ↔ DistinctStationaryConjecture ↔ StationaryConjecture`.

The composed declaration is
`LonelyRunner.conjecture_iff_stationaryConjecture`.

`LonelyRunner.PositiveIntegerConjecture` records the pairwise-distinct
positive-integer formulation; no real-to-integer reduction is assumed.

## 4. Verified partial mathematics

The statement-equivalence layer builds cleanly, and its axiom audit reports
only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`. The quantitative insertion
theorem is formalized as `LonelyRunner.fastRunnerInsertion`: a new relative
speed of magnitude at least `k` times each of the `k-1` old speed magnitudes can
be inserted by perturbing the old witness within the exact available slack.

The one-moving-runner base case is formalized as
`LonelyRunner.oneMovingRunner`: for nonzero relative speed `v`, the explicit
time `1/(2v)` places the runner at circular distance exactly `1/2`.

Two further structured classes are proved in `docs/structured-classes.md`.
The first uses the explicit time determined by a positive base scale when
every normalized magnitude lies in one of a family of closed residue bands.
It is formalized as `LonelyRunner.minimumScaleResidueBands`, supported by
`circleNorm_neg`, `circleNorm_abs`, `circleNorm_ge_of_int_band`, and
`circleNorm_ge_of_abs_int_band`. The second treats two rational rank-one blocks
whose scales have irrational ratio and whose internal multiplier spreads are
small; it uses nonempty open good arcs and the exact two-torus density
criterion. The second result is not yet a Lean declaration and is not used by
any formal theorem in this manuscript.

For fixed positive integer tuples, `docs/modular-pivot-certificates.md`
develops exact finite bad sets on grids with denominator `(n+1)a_j`. The
purely finite implications are formalized as
`LonelyRunner.card_biUnion_le_sum_card`,
`LonelyRunner.exists_mem_avoiding_of_sum_card_lt_card`,
`LonelyRunner.card_union_le_card_add_selected_remainder`, and
`LonelyRunner.card_ordered_union_le_sum_selected_remainders`, followed by
`LonelyRunner.exists_mem_avoiding_ordered_of_sum_lt_card`. These prove that a
strict cardinality or ordered-overlap certificate leaves an uncovered finite
candidate.
The gcd formula for the individual bad-set sizes and the connection from the
modular residue model to `circleNorm` remain paper proofs plus exact executable
tests, so no end-to-end modular theorem is labeled formal.

## 5. Remaining obstruction

No audited route currently controls all primitive integer tuples in all
dimensions. Fast-runner induction leaves comparable speeds; finite checking
still requires a separate finite computation in every dimension; Fourier
methods do not reach the sharp constant; and the universal shifted-zonotope
strengthening is false. These are mathematical obstructions, not Lean syntax
issues. In particular, the two-parent modular certificate succeeds throughout
the audited primitive speed-30 boxes for 3--5 moving runners, but no theorem
forces such a certificate for unbounded speeds.
